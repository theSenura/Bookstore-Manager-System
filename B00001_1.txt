Dr James Mortimer calls upon Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson in London to ask for advice. He explains that he is a doctor working in a tiny village called Grimpen in Dartmoor in Devon. One of his friends and patients, Sir Charles Baskerville, an elderly but extremely wealthy baronet, has recently been found dead from an apparent heart attack in the grounds of his country house, Baskerville Hall. An autopsy revealed that Sir Charles had a weak heart and had spent many years suffering from heart disease. However, Dr Mortimer has found an old paper about Sir Charles's family.
