Written in 1742, the document is set a century earlier in the 1600s, about a supposed legend. At that time, Baskerville Hall was inhabited by Sir Hugo Baskerville, a wild, profane and godless man. Sir Hugo had become infatuated with the daughter of a yeomen who held lands near to the Baskerville estate. One night, when the girl's father and    brothers were out, he abducted her and locked her in his room. One night with his friends, he discovered that the girl had escaped and he chased her across the moor. His friends       overheard him say that he would sell his soul to the devil, to overtake the girl. When his friends caught up with him, the girl had died of exhaustion and fear. Then a huge, gigantic  and enormous hound appeared and tore out the throat of Sir Hugo Baskerville, killing him. Some of the friends died of fear that very night and the rest were broken men for the rest of their lives. The hound is then said to purge and haunt the entire family, whose deaths have been bloody, violent, and mysterious.
